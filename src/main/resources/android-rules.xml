      <description><![CDATA[Earlier versions of the Android tools bundled a single <code>proguard.cfg</code> file containing a ProGuard configuration file suitable for Android shrinking and obfuscation. However, that version was copied into new projects, which means that it does not continue to get updated as we improve the default ProGuard rules for Android.<br/>
<br/>
In the new version of the tools, we have split the ProGuard configuration into two halves:<br/>
* A simple configuration file containing only project-specific flags, in your project<br/>
* A generic configuration file containing the recommended set of ProGuard options for Android projects. This generic file lives in the SDK install directory which means that it gets updated along with the tools.<br/>
<br/>
In order for this to work, the proguard.config property in the <code>project.properties</code> file now refers to a path, so you can reference both the generic file as well as your own (and any additional files too).<br/>
<br/>
To migrate your project to the new setup, create a new <code>proguard-project.txt</code> file in your project containing any project specific ProGuard flags as well as any customizations you have made, then update your project.properties file to contain:<br/>
<code>proguard.config=${sdk.dir}/tools/proguard/proguard-android.txt:proguard-project.txt</code>]]></description>

<br/>
There <b>are</b> cases where you might need to use <code>dp</code>; typically this happens when the text is in a container with a specific dp-size. This will prevent the text from spilling outside the container. Note however that this means that the user's font size settings are not respected, so consider adjusting the layout itself to be more flexible.]]></description>

It is documented at <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#allowBackup">http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#allowBackup</a><br/>
<br/>
By default, this flag is set to <code>true</code>. When this flag is set to <code>true</code>, application data can be backed up and restored by the user using <code>adb backup</code> and <code>adb restore</code>.<br/>
<br/>
This may have security consequences for an application. <code>adb backup</code> allows users who have enabled USB debugging to copy application data off of the device. Once backed up, all application data can be read by the user. <code>adb restore</code> allows creation of application data from a source specified by the user. Following a restore, applications should not assume that the data, file permissions, and directory permissions were created by the application itself.<br/>
<br/>
Setting <code>allowBackup="false"</code> opts an application out of both backup and restore.<br/>
<br/>
To fix this warning, decide whether your application should support backup, and explicitly set <code>android:allowBackup=(true|false)"</code>]]></description>

<br/>
NOTE: This detector relies on figuring out which layouts are associated with which activities based on scanning the Java code, and it's currently doing that using an inexact pattern matching algorithm. Therefore, it can incorrectly conclude which activity the layout is associated with and then wrongly complain that a background-theme is hidden.<br/>
<br/>
If you want your custom background on multiple pages, then you should consider making a custom theme with your custom background and just using that theme instead of a root element background.<br/>
<br/>
Of course it's possible that your custom drawable is translucent and you want it to be mixed with the background. However, you will get better performance if you pre-mix the background with your drawable and use that resulting image or color as a custom theme background instead.<br/>

<br/>
The lint detector also looks at the <code>id</code> of the view, and if the id offers a hint of the purpose of the field (for example, the <code>id</code> contains the phrase <code>phone</code> or <code>email</code>), then lint will also ensure that the <code>inputType</code> contains the corresponding type attributes.<br/>
